# INFO8003-1: Optimal Decision Making for Complex Problems
## Project 1: Reinforcement Learning in a Discrete Domain
### Authors: Romain LAMBERMONT (s190931), Arthur LOUIS (S191230)

This project is part of the course of Optimal Decision Making for Complex Problems at the University of Li√®ge. The course is given by Prof. Damien Ernst with the help of his teaching assistants Arthur Louette and Bardhyl Miftari. The goal of this project is to implement a reinforcement learning algorithm in a discrete domain, a matrix where each cell reached by the agent returns a reward. The report can be seen [here](./report/report.pdf).
